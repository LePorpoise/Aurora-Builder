      <p>At at 2nd level, when a Stand User is damaged by a hostile creature, you make a DC 11 constitution check to see if you can gain 1 stack of Exchange Blows. On a success, you gain an extra attack when you or your stand uses a melee attack. You can only have up to your proficiency bonus amount of stacks and you gain an extra attack for each stack. You can use your bonus action to roll a check for an extra stack of Exchange Blows, as long as you have at least 1. These extra attacks are shared by both you and your stand. Using extra attacks during your turn does not consume the stacks. You may spend 1 stack to attack a creature, using either your or your stand's melee attack that attacks you during their turn if they are within range without using a reaction. All stacks are removed once you can no longer fighting any hostile creatures. </p>

When a creature makes an attack against you, you can use 1 stack of Stando Powa! to completely negate the damage/effect; this does not consume a reaction. Projectiles are deflected and attacks are countered by your or your stand's weapons. Furthermore, if you fail an attack roll, you may expend 3 stack of Stando Powa! to change the failed roll into a success. You can have up to your proficiency bonus amount of stacks. If you are at max stacks, you may expend all of them instead of the usual 1 stack to have your attack become a critical hit that uses the max damage roll. You do not gain stacks from a successful hit caused by expending a stack. Stando Powa! stacks stay with you until you are no longer fighting any hostile creatures. </p>
